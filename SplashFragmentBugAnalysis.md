# SplashFragment Bug Analysis and Fixes

## Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Bug 1: Incomplete Full-Screen Implementation
**Problem**: 
```kotlin
requireActivity().window.decorView.systemUiVisibility = (
    View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN or
    View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION or
    View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY
)
```

**Issues**:
- Missing layout flags for proper full-screen experience
- No API level handling for Android 11+
- Doesn't work properly with gesture navigation

**Fix**: Added proper full-screen implementation with all necessary flags and API level handling.

### Bug 2: Interfering with Edge-to-Edge in onPause()
**Problem**: 
```kotlin
override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    requireActivity().window.decorView.systemUiVisibility = View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_VISIBLE
}
```

**Issues**:
- Resets system UI to normal mode when fragment is paused
- Interferes with edge-to-edge mode in subsequent screens
- Causes jarring UI transitions

**Fix**: Removed the system UI reset in onPause() and moved it to onStop() with proper conditions.

### Bug 3: Wrong Lifecycle Owner for Observer
**Problem**: 
```kotlin
viewModel.uiState.observe(this) { ... }
```

**Issues**:
- Using fragment as lifecycle owner instead of viewLifecycleOwner
- Can cause crashes when fragment view is destroyed but fragment instance remains
- Memory leaks possible

**Fix**: Changed to `viewLifecycleOwner`:
```kotlin
viewModel.uiState.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { ... }
```

### Bug 4: No Transition Preparation for Edge-to-Edge
**Problem**: Navigation happens immediately without preparing the target screen for edge-to-edge mode.

**Issues**:
- Abrupt transition from full-screen to normal mode
- Edge-to-edge not properly enabled for next screens
- Poor user experience

**Fix**: Added `enableEdgeToEdgeForNextActivity()` method that prepares the window for edge-to-edge before navigation.

### Bug 5: Missing API Level Handling
**Problem**: No consideration for Android 11+ window insets API changes.

**Issues**:
- May not work properly on Android 11+
- Missing `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` for proper edge-to-edge

**Fix**: Added proper API level handling for both full-screen and edge-to-edge modes.

### Bug 6: No Smooth Transition
**Problem**: Immediate navigation without any transition delay.

**Issues**:
- Jarring user experience
- No time for UI state to settle

**Fix**: Added small delay using lifecycleScope for smoother transitions.

### Bug 7: Improper System UI Restoration
**Problem**: System UI is restored even when navigating to other screens.

**Issues**:
- Interferes with the target screen's UI mode
- Causes flickering during transitions

**Fix**: Added condition to only restore system UI when not navigating away.

### Bug 8: Missing Layout Flags
**Problem**: Original implementation missing important layout flags.

**Issues**:
- Content may be obscured by system bars
- Inconsistent behavior across devices

**Fix**: Added all necessary layout flags for proper full-screen experience.

## Implementation Details

### Full-Screen Mode (Splash)
- Hides status bar and navigation bar completely
- Uses immersive sticky mode for better UX
- Handles both pre-Android 11 and Android 11+ APIs

### Edge-to-Edge Mode (After Navigation)
- Shows system bars but makes them transparent/translucent
- Content extends behind system bars
- Proper for modern Android UI guidelines

### Transition Strategy
1. **Splash loads**: Full immersive mode activated
2. **Before navigation**: Edge-to-edge mode prepared
3. **After navigation**: Target screen handles its own insets
4. **On back/stop**: System UI properly restored if needed

## Usage Example

```kotlin
// In your LandingActivity or MainActivity
class LandingActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        // Don't set edge-to-edge here - let SplashFragment handle it
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_landing)
    }
}

// In your MainActivity (after splash)
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        // Edge-to-edge should already be set by SplashFragment
        // Just set up your window insets handling
        setupWindowInsets()
        
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper API level handling** - Works on all Android versions
2. **Smooth transitions** - No jarring UI changes
3. **Correct lifecycle management** - No crashes or memory leaks
4. **Better UX** - Seamless transition from splash to main content
5. **Edge-to-edge preparation** - Next screens get proper edge-to-edge setup
6. **Conditional system UI restoration** - Only when actually needed

This implementation ensures your splash screen has the full immersive experience you want, while properly preparing subsequent screens for edge-to-edge mode without conflicts.
